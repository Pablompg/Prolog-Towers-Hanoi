# Prolog Algorithms. A*

This is my intelligent systems final assignment. The problem being solved is similar to the _Towers of Hanoi_ problem, for which the A* search algorithm is implemented allowing the user to chose between different heuristics to find the optimum path. As always when using prolog, a recursive aproach is used.


## Problem

> Imagine we have a series of Pancakes of different sizes stacked one on top of the other. Lets assume we have *'n'* panckes and all of them differ in size. For a given start state find the optimum path to the desired final state which also needs to be given. 
The pancackes can only be moved as if a spatula was being used, as in the following image.

## Approach
The A* search algorithm has being implemented using two different heuristics. The menu gives the user the option of choosing which one to use.
